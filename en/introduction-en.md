This is the Nehemiah Archives, an archive of events, articles, and resources on modern Christianity. The purpose of this archive is to record and organize information which is scattered into multiple countries, languages and years to reduce some bias on certain evangelical movements and persecuted churches. This archive also aims to uncover motivations, activities, historical background, tactics and strategies of anti-Christian groups which intentionally caused that bias.
